I'll be showing you a real-time chatting application that I developed using Apache NetBeans. The application is built using Java Swing as an API and socket programming as the major tech. I'll be explaining how the client and server methods work, which is also known as the handshake method. We'll see how the server model needs to run for the client model to work. I'll also show you how to run the file and open the chatting window. We'll then switch to the client model and see how it runs. Finally, I'll demonstrate how you can use this application to form a real-time chatting application for your website or a client-server model. Enjoy!
